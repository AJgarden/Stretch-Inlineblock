# Stretch-Inlineblock

Must include jQuery library 1.9+ front of this script.<br><br>
Stretch every row of inline-block element to same height.<br>
Though CSS 'flex' can stretch the flexbox to same height, but old IE doesn't support 'flex'.<br>
If your website want to be run on old IE, you can try this plugin.<br><br>
